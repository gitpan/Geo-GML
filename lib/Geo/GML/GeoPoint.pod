=head1 NAME

Geo::GML::GeoPoint - convert Geo::Point objects into GML

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $geopoint = Geo::Surface->new(...);
 my $gml  = Geo::GML->new('WRITER', version => '3.2.1');
 my $data;
 $data->{..somewhere..} = $gml->GPtoGML($geopoint);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Convert Geo::Point objects into GML data structures.  The implementation
is partial: please help with providing me with examples.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Helpers

$obj-E<gt>B<GPtoGML>(OBJECT, OPTIONS)

=over 4

 Option--Default
 srs     <from OBJECT>

. srs => SRS-name

=over 4

Overrule the projection name as found in the Geo::Point object, which
is just a simple label.  Be sure that your OBJECT is in the correct
projection, for instance via

   $gml->GPtoGML($gp->in('wgs84'), srs => 'EPGS:4326');
